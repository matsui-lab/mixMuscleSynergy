\title{Plot All Factor Scores (Z) for MFA, Faceted by Cluster and Factor}
\usage{
plot_all_factor_scores_mfa(mfa_fit, list_of_data, overlay_subjects = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mfa_fit}{A fitted MFA model (with z, Lambda, Psi, mu, etc.).}

\item{list_of_data}{A list of (T_i x M) data matrices.}

\item{overlay_subjects}{Logical; if TRUE, all subjects in the same cluster
are overlaid in the same facet. If FALSE, you could average them, etc.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object that shows the factor scores over time,
  with facets by (Cluster, Factor).
}
\description{
This function computes the factor scores Z_i(t) for each subject i,
identifies that subject's cluster k, and then creates a large facet plot
of the time evolution of each factor (1..r) in each cluster (1..K).
Optionally overlays all subjects in the same cluster.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  p <- plot_all_factor_scores_mfa(my_mfa_fit, list_of_data)
  print(p)
}
