\title{Extract subject-level features by single PCA}
\usage{
extract_subject_features_by_singlePCA(list_of_data, r_dim = 2)

extract_subject_features_by_singlePCA(list_of_data, r_dim = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_of_data}{A list of \code{(T_i x M)} matrices.}

\item{r_dim}{Number of principal components to use for feature extraction.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of shape \code{(N x r_dim)}, where \code{N=length(list_of_data)}.

A \code{(N x r_dim)} matrix, where N=length(list_of_data).
}
\description{
This function applies PCA to the concatenated data across all subjects,
then for each subject \code{i}, computes the mean of the top \code{r_dim} principal
component scores as a single feature vector.

Similar to the MFA case, we apply PCA to the concatenated data, then average
the top \code{r_dim} PC scores for each subject.
